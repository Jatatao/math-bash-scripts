# math-bash-scripts
I have no idea what I'm doing. I wrote some basic bash scripts for math with some basic tutorial.  I just wanted to upload it here.
just download the bash scripts and run them in your linux terminal i guess.
comes with basic division, basic subtraction, basic multiplication, and basic addition.
